In parallel to this effort, the DevOps transformation recently piloted in the Pet Clinic is about to be rolled out across the wider group. For details on the Pet Clinic's DevOps transformation see [Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/modules/).

The team expects that the DevOps transformation will support and improve the following Product Engineering lifecycle phases

- Design & Development

- QA & Testing

- Product Delivery

- Product Support

- Product Maintenance

However the team has identified a gap which needs to be addressed in the early Product Engineering lifecycle phases

- Ideation and Conceptualization

- Architecture and Prototyping

The team wants these critical phases to be seamlessly integrated with the subsequent phases. They believe that having teams adapt Design Thinking will ensure a strong interlock is established between the Architecture & Prototyping phase and the Design & Development phase.

The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of Design Thinking. It includes a series of conversational snippets taken at various points in the timeline of the evaluation and introduction of Design Thinking in support of the Product Engineering lifecycle in the Universal Imports Group.
