# Preface

Humans love stories, the urge to tell stories is in our DNA.

This book can be considered as the novelization of DXC's recently open sourced [Online Product Engineering Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-pe-dojo/modules/). The [Online Product Engineering Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-pe-dojo/modules/) takes a role-based story telling approach to help achieve hands-on learning at scale.

The [Online Product Engineering Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-pe-dojo/modules/) modules are set in the same **Pet Clinic** multi-verse as DXC's Online DevOps Dojo - [https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/).

Both dojos place learners in real-world-like scenarios, scenarios where they work with a virtual cast of characters from the **Universal Imports** group, sharing the challenges and aspirations of the team as they learn about Product Engineering.

## Foreword

Seeing the evolution of IT in the last 30 years it has been obvious from the start that the combination of technology, people and processes all need to evolve at the same time for organizations to see the true benefit from the modern era.

Although in software development the power of the team and the adoption of agile processes is a proven and well documented mode of operation, the extension of this wider into the IT landscape has been harder for organizations to adopt. The movement to a Product Engineering operating model is difficult and requires a set of steppingstones to get there.

One the biggest inertias to this is that organizations do appreciate the power to the team and role which are played in that team, simply branding people a scrum master or product owner does not work. These roles / characters play a critical part, but we struggle to understand how they should interact.

Step in ‘Product Engineering’ and its unique way to portray the roles and functions needed to successfully operate through a multi-verse (**Pet Clinic**) experience, making characters relatable to corporate roles whilst applying a simple yet powerful set of proven methods.

This book is aimed at all levels, and functions in corporate structure, for those starting includes managers and execs who want to become better informed, or those operating in development teams and want to refine their thinking.

A simple but creative way to help provide knowledge and learning in modern techniques that will be a game changer for how you handle product development.
