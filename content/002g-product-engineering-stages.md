The team have discussed and agreed on the

- Definition of Product Engineering

- Role of Product Engineer

- Skill set required by Product Engineer

Following a series of workshops the team agree to recommend and to start implementing the following Product Engineering Cycle in the Universal Imports Group.

| **Phase**                          | **Description**                                                                                                                | **Comments**                                                             |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ideation and Conceptualization** | Conceive the idea. Document it. Idea worth pursuing or not?                                                                    | UI/UX prototyping tools like [Axure](https://www.axure.com/)             |
| **Architecture and Prototyping**   | Create engineering designs. Bring finalized concept to life. | Look to design companies like DXC's [argodesign](https://argodesign.com/) |
| **Design & Development**           | Develop both product features and all supporting requirements including CI/CD pipelines, Test Automation & SRE needs. Manage implementation costs. | ![](assets/devopslifecycle.png) |
| **System Testing, Scans, and UAT** | System testing, scans and UAT. Validate developed product meets the intended use and is fault free. Identify & fix any issues. | ![](assets/devopslifecycle.png) |
| **Product Delivery** | Release to market.  | ![](assets/devopslifecycle.png) |
| **Product Support**                | Periodic updates and enhancements. Maintenance. Support.  | ![](assets/devopslifecycle.png) | | **Product Maintenance**            | Facilitate scaling and product evolution.  | ![](assets/devopslifecycle.png) |

**Note:** Take the **Getting Started** chapter in this book to learn how the workshops were conducted and for more details as to the outcomes from the workshops.

The team aim to ensure the recommended Product Engineering lifecycle becomes seamlessly integrated with Agile, Lean and DevOps practices across the group:

They believe Design Thinking to have the potential to become a key enabler of the **Ideation and Conceptualization** and **Architecture and Prototyping** phases of the Product Engineering lifecycle.

**Note:** See the **Design Thinking** chapter in this book for how Design Thinking can be applied to solve complex problems, and provide solutions for customers.
