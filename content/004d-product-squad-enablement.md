## Product Squad Enablement

I think any help we provide has to be guided by the Universal Import Groups' **Product Engineering Manifesto** we just created.

_We are uncovering better ways of engineering products by doing it and helping others do it._

_Through this work we have come to value these 12 principles:_
- _Focus on Customers underpinned by a deep empathy for their needs._
- _Make Data Driven Decisions at all stages of the product life cycle._
- _Foster a Culture of Experimentation via Ideation, Validation, Realization, Feedback and Iteration._
- _Engage, Coach, Empower, Support Teams and Team Members._
- _Value on Practice over Theory, Guidelines over Standards & Culture over Tooling._
- _Create loosely coupled components supported by APIs, Microservices & Integrations._
- _Actively work to optimize flow across the entire value stream._
- _Aim for optimal DevOps - Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery - per product._
- _Apply Inner Source Principles supported by an Everything as Code first approach._
- _Celebrate Success / Learn from Failures._
- _Everybody's free (to Automate Testing)._
- _Encourage teams to have fun, if they don't enjoy making a product, chances are consumers won't enjoy using it._

We can't expect teams to hit all those marks out of the gate, but we need to ensure that teams are able to commit time to both Product (building new features) and Engineering (documentation, addressing technical debt, monitoring etc) activities.

Our Product Owners have a key role in ensuring that balance between Product and Engineering work is maintained.

Agreed, we can do that by creating appropriate Feature and Enabler epics in the respective product backlogs and ensuring the squads are given sufficient time to work on both types of epics.
