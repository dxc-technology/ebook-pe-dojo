## Design Thinking vs Traditional Thinking

![](assets/miyagi.png)

The adoption of Design Thinking may require a significant cultural shift on the part of an organization, a shift from what may be termed as "Traditional Thinking" to Design Thinking.

For the purposes of this discussion, "Traditional Thinking" can be considered as taking a methodical and scientific approach to problem solving. In this approach, a problem is defined, the process and tools to generate a solution are identified, then a plan is created and followed in the expectation of arriving at the desired outcomes.

Design Thinking takes a different approach, an approach which can be described as follow

- Focuses on user expectations

- Expectations, once defined, result in ideas

- The most promising ideas are embodied in the form of prototypes

- Prototypes, once tested, are turned into products and services to improve user experiences.
