## Product Engineering Manifesto

Inspired by the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) the team settle on the following draft **Product Engineering Manifesto** for the Universal Imports Group.

_We are uncovering better ways of engineering products by doing it and helping others do it._

_Through this work we have come to value these 12 principles:_

- _Focus on Customers underpinned by a deep empathy for their needs._

- _Make Data Driven Decisions at all stages of the product life cycle._

- _Foster a Culture of Experimentation via Ideation, Validation, Realization, Feedback and Iteration._

- _Engage, Coach, Empower, Support Teams and Team Members._

- _Value on Practice over Theory, Guidelines over Standards & Culture over Tooling._

- _Create loosely coupled components supported by APIs, Microservices & Integrations._

- _Actively work to optimize flow across the entire value stream._

- _Aim for optimal DevOps - Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery - per product._

- _Apply Inner Source Principles supported by an Everything as Code first approach._

- _Celebrate Success / Learn from Failures._

- _Everybody's free (to Automate Testing)._

- _Encourage teams to have fun, as if they don't enjoy making a product chances are consumers won't enjoy using it._
