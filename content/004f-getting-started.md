## Getting Started

The team have agreed to follow a Product Engineering approach using Design Thinking - Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype & Test - to Introduce Product Engineering across the Universal Imports Group

Miyagi reminds everyone of the teams' Defined mission statement:

_Improve the Product Engineering Practices across the Universal Imports Group_

and of their agreed Product:

_A set of best practices representing the recommended Product Engineering Practices for the Universal Imports Group and collateral to help teams implement those practices_

The team meet. Ideas ebb and flow. Serious amounts of ![](assets/pizza.png)![](assets/pizza.png)![](assets/pizza.png)![](assets/pizza.png) and ![](assets/coffee.png)![](assets/coffee.png)![](assets/coffee.png)![](assets/coffee.png) are consumed.

Deliberations are intense, engaging and heated at times but ultimately rewarding.

The results of those discussions is the following Getting Started with Product Engineering steps for teams across the Universal Imports Group.

- **Teams are to adapt the groups' Product Engineering Manifesto.**

- **Teams are to appoint a champion to spearhead the introduction of Product Engineering.**

A champion is a squad member empowered and willing to lead the introduction of Production Engineering in a squad. They are authorized to facilitate the 'pull' of Product Engineering into the squad whilst ensuring the squad is aligned with both the pivot in the organization's culture and the companyâ€™s goals.

- **Champions will participate in a bi-weekly Product Engineering Guild.**

A Guild, another concept introduced by Spotify, is basically a community of interest. Guilds are where people from different squads can help each other and exchange information on a topic.

- **Communication facilitates flow squads need to work to improve communication pathways.**

Product squads need to continually optimize flow, one of the best ways of doing that is communication with both upstream and downstream stakeholders.

- **Iteration provides a pathway to rapid value creation.**

Product squads focus on delivering a solution that will address the problem at hand as quickly as possible. That solution may not be perfect initially but as the customer and the squad learn more about the problem domain the solution is improved in subsequent iterations.

- **Cherish and encourage direct customer interactions.**

Product squads need to have a clear understanding of customer expectations, wishes and problems, to better influence product direction. They best way to get this understanding is direct customer interactions at all stages of the product lifecycle.

- **Establishing a culture of experimentation is essential.**

Experimentation often drives innovation, high performing squads realize this simple truth and foster a culture of experimentation in the squad. This can be experimenting with new ways of doing things, new tools, new technologies etc. all done with the aim of engineering a better product.

- **Allocate time for both Product and Feature work.**

Squads need to commit time to both Product (building new features) and Engineering (documentation, addressing technical debt, monitoring etc) work. That can often mean going slower when developing features, in order to have the robust engineering and automations in place to enable the squad to go faster in the long run.

- **Celebrate successes, learn from failures and have fun.**

Happy and engaged teams build better products, successes should be celebrated and lessons should be viewed as learning opportunities.
