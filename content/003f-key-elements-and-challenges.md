## Key Elements and Challenges

### Key Elements

There are a number of elements key to the successful adaption of Design Thinking:

- _People-centered_ - Empathy is key - Focus on what people, users, customers, consumers, etc. need or want to do.

- _Highly Creative_ - Look at problems differently - Problems are opportunities to add value & to come up with new solutions.

- _Show, Donâ€™t Tell_ - Use visuals to communicate what you are thinking.

- _Hands-on_ - Less talking, more making - Use prototypes and have users validate them - Realize that failure is a (necessary) part of the process - The trick is to fail fast and to incorporate any learnings from those failures in the eventual solutions.

- _Iterative Process_ - Process depends on having lots of ideas - Prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining one or more of those ideas in to a solution.

- _Transparent Collaboration_ - Bring together designers, innovators and stakeholders with different backgrounds, skills and viewpoints.

### Challenges

There are also challenges in successfully adapting Design Thinking. There is a need to:

- _Accept more ambiguity_ - Better experiences are difficult to quantify in terms of value delivered.

- _Embrace risk_ - Iterative innovation is inherently risky - Requires trust and a culture which allows people to take risks sometimes when only having a partial understanding of the problem domain.

- _Set realistic expectations_ - Design is not a cure for all ills, stakeholder expectations need to be managed appropriately and aligned to a realistic delivery timeline.

Thank you **M**iyagi. I think we all now have a better understanding of how companies which commit to the cultural pivot can achieve strong interlocks between design and development.
