The session is facilitated by **M**iyagi. Before starting the session **M**iyagi reminds the team that:

- Everyone should feel free to contribute any and all ideas to the session.

- There is no such thing as a bad or a silly idea.

- Everyone is free to build upon the ideas of others.

- People are encouraged to challenge the expected norms.

- Everyone has an equal voice.

- Initial aim is for quantity over quality, so as soon as an idea occurs to them they are to add it to the board.

The brainstorming session results in the following ideas.

In the planning session the team will select the best ideas and put a plan in place to action them.
