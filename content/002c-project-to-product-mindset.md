## Moving from a Project to a Product Mindset

![](assets/pennyworth.png)

I am happy with what we have agreed to focus on as a team.

In my opinion, this is not primarily a re-tooling exercise, this is about making a cultural pivot. Of course that pivot may in time need to be supported by tooling.

We found that culture rather than tooling was key to the success of the Pet Clinic's DevOps transformation.

I agree that establishing a Product Engineering culture is important. I think that encouraging teams to move from a project to a product mindset is key to the delivery of incremental value to the business via continuous product innovation. We need to ensure we factor what such a move might entail into our considerations.

To facilitate those considerations I offer the following definitions of a project and a product.

### Project

A project is designed to achieve a specific goal. Projects typically have a set lifespan with a defined beginning and a defined end. They may involve the formation of a dedicated project team to deliver the project.

### Product

A product is a solution created to address the needs of a particular set of customers, the aim is to create one solution to address the needs of many customers. Software Products come in many forms including applications, APIs, managed services, platforms etc. Products are typically developed, deployed and operated by dedicated product teams or product squads.

### Cultural Impacts

I would like to note for the record before the "Project Managers" guild, with **P**ennyworth leading them, turn up at my door with torches and pitchforks ala Shrek that the following cultural impacts are not intended as sweeping generalized statements as to the ills of a Project Management approach.

These impacts are intended to convey how the cultural challenges that exist in **many** organizations and in **many** projects which can be addressed by a pivot to a product mindset.
