## Conclusion

In this chapter we introduced the scenario and the cast of characters that will be used in this book.

Hopefully upon completing the rest of the chapters in the **Product Engineering** book, the next time you or your team have a need for a bigger ![](assets/boat.png) it will be Product Engineered accordingly.

Buckle up we are going on an adventure, where we are going we don't need roads ![](assets/rocket.png) but first an optional challenge ...

![](assets/telephone.png)![](assets/telephone.png)![](assets/telephone.png) **Call** ![](assets/telephone.png)![](assets/telephone.png)![](assets/telephone.png) for curious students ![](assets/alien.png)![](assets/baby.png)![](assets/bear.png)![](assets/boy.png)![](assets/cat.png)![](assets/man.png)![](assets/man_with_turban.png)![](assets/alien.png).

The challenge is to take some time to consider and make some notes as to your current understanding of and on the use of Product Engineering in your team.

The ask is that you review and reflect on those notes upon completion of the **Product Engineering** book. Good luck with the challenge.
