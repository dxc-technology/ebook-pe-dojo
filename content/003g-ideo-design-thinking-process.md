## IDEO Design Thinking Process

Design Thinking provides a structure for the innovation process.

Design Thinking as we have learnt per the Stanford model is a five stage process:

**_Empathize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test_**

IDEO, a design and consultancy firm, recommend a similar process for innovation:

**_Understand -> Observe -> Visualize / Realize -> Evaluate -> Implement_**

The phases in the IDEO model are closely aligned with the _phases_ in the Stanford model.

Understand => _Empathize_
- Client
- Market
- Technology

Observe => _Define_
- Sources of Confusion?
- What is disliked?
- What needs are not being met?

Visualize / Realize => _Ideate_
- Role Play
- Create story boards
- Build early stage Prototype

Evaluate / Refine => _Prototype_
- Expect to have to create several prototypes
- Concurrent engineering

Implement => _Test_
- Verify the final product works
- Commercialize
- Go to market
