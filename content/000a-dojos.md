## Dojos

This book's roots lie in a number of interactive dojos which DXC developed to train it's own employees and subsequently open sourced in order to share with the wider community.

### DevOps Dojos

DevOps Dojos became popular after Target, an important U.S.-based retail company, started to introduce such a practice back in 2014 in support of its DevOps transformation. Since then, multiple conference talks, white papers and books have been published about DevOps Dojos.

DXC have been running DevOps Dojos for own employees and customers for some time, however we quickly came to a point where our physical DevOps Dojos were not enough to meet the demand.

Everyone loved the dojo experience, and to this day the on-site experience still leads to great results. However we had a scalability issue: we could not accommodate everyone we needed to accommodate in the face to face dojos. To address our scalability issues we developed an interactive browser based DevOps Dojo for our staff.

Following the success of that effort we released an open source version of our DevOps Dojo - the [Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo).

In parallel we continued to apply the Dojo model to other problem domains including Product Engineering.

### Product Engineering Dojo

DXC delivers the IT services our customers need to modernize operations and drive innovation across their entire IT estate.

- We help customers create a rich workplace experience, simplify and optimize on-premises IT, and achieve a secure, high-performance cloud environment to realize positive business outcomes.

- Our services weave cyber resilience throughout the enterprise, help customers reimagine business with transformative applications, and enable data-driven decisions, automation and state-of-the-art engineering.

- DXC business process outsourcing helps customers transform operations to a digital business model.

DXCâ€™s customer-centric approach is facilitated by the judicious application of Product Engineering, underpinned by Agile and DevOps principles.

As a result DXC invests heavily in helping customer-facing teams adopt new approaches like Product Engineering to increase their agility, collaboration and responsiveness to customer needs.

Product Engineering embraces concepts of design thinking, which aims to create better products and services by understanding how users interact with them and the conditions under which they are to operate. It emphasizes bidirectional communication, feedback loops, learning from mistakes and experiential approaches.

DXC needed to provide training to help our people make the cultural shift from a project mindset to a product mindset, to address that training need we created the interactive browser based **Product Engineering Dojo**.

The objective being to help ensure the software applications and integrations we develop, as well as the managed services we provide, are better suited to the needs of the business and the demands of the market.

### Open Sourcing

Internally DXC uses the **Product Engineering Dojo** to:

- Train people at scale on Product Engineering.

- Help people prepare for a face-to-face or virtual Product Engineering Dojos and / or Design Thinking Workshops by learning associated techniques in advance.

- Provide a Product Engineering curriculum comprised of interactive browser based modules to allow students access and consume knowledge as and when they need it.

- Share what "good looks like" when answering enquiries in relation to Product Engineering and / or Design Thinking patterns.

In addition following on from the success of the [Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo) - continue to leverage the story and the characters by extending the story and thus create more learning experiences - in effect creating a **Pet Clinic** multi-verse.

To continue giving something back to the community we released an open source version of our Product Engineering Dojo entitled the [Online Product Engineering Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-pe-dojo).

### Universal Imports - A Story

One of our ongoing challenges as coaches is to make the learning experience engaging. There is nothing better than a good story to engage people, so we created one to support our training.

The Product Engineering Dojo tells the story of a fictitious group of companies, the "Universal Imports Group" and its employees as they embark on their Product Engineering journey. You will meet those employees in subsequent chapters, share their journey and hopefully gain some insights that will help you in your own Product Engineering journey.
