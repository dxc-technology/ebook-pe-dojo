## Our Cast

Before we proceed lets take a few minutes to catch up with some of the Pet Clinic crew and to meet some new friends from the other companies in the Universal Imports Group.

We will share in their challenges, opportunities and achievements as our story unfolds.

This book has several characters which play a role throughout the story. Some of these characters were originally introduced in the [Online DevOps Dojo](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/modules/).

Charlie has gathered the following key individuals together from across the group to lead the adoption of Product Engineering in the Universal Imports Group under a program called **Overlook**.

### Charlie (CEO)

**C**harlie is a technology entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist.

Charlie is a serial disruptor, he understands the importance of adaptability and speed.

Being an entrepreneur he has had successes and failures in the past, he expects to have more successes and indeed more failures in the future.

He views the discipline of Product Engineering as being essential to tilting the scales in favour of future successes.

His motto is to _"Better to fail fast if you are likely to fail at all"_ hence he is keen to see more work done in the design and prototyping phases of projects.

### Miyagi (Product Engineering Mentor)

**M**iyagi Product Engineering Coach and Mentor hired by Charlie to help increase the use of Product Engineering within the Universal Imports Group.

Miyagi's coaching philosophy is to engage, coach, empower and support the teams he works with, and in doing so enable those teams to solve problems for themselves.

He finds coaching to be a rewarding experience but on the rare occasions it is not, he de-stresses by doing a little DIY including painting fences, sanding floors and waxing cars.

Miyagi has worked in a number of industry and sectors. He has coached clients in how to design and develop better products at scale.

Miyagi is keen to apply those learnings in the Universal Imports Group and to also learn from the good work in the space already underway across the group.

### Adriana (Architect) - InGen - Space Exploration Company

**A**driana the **A**rchitect working on the R237 control software for Redrum, InGen's revolutionary rocket designed for suborbital flights.

She caught the space bug as a child watching the lunar landings on a grainy old TV set and is busy pursuing her passion for all things Space with InGen.

Adriana has an interest in all phases of the Product Engineering life cycle, but has a particular interest in architecture for testability.

She wants to ensure the rockets InGen plan to send to infinity (figuratively speaking) and beyond return safely.

### Pennyworth (Project Manager) -  The Daily Mentioner - National Newspaper

**P**ennyworth a **P**roject Manager from the Daily Mentioner national newspaper is a servant leader, he facilitates the work of the teams on the projects he manages.

A loyal and longstanding confidant of Charlie, Pennyworth often acts as Charlie's weather _wayne_ pardon the pun on new programs.

Pennyworth works to ensure that new programs become shining examples of best practices and is thus ideally suited to helping on the Overlook program.

### Paulo (Product Owner) - Pet Clinic Application

**P**aulo is an Agile **P**roduct Owner for the Pet Clinic company.

Paulo works with the Pet Clinic business to understand what functionality is needed, why it is needed and when it is needed. He then manages the back log, working with the development team to groom the backlog in response to the evolving business priorities.

Paulo perhaps inspired by his pet cat, John Connor, regularly comments "The backlog has not been written. There is not fate but for what we make for ourselves" much to the bemusement of the team.

Paulo is excited by the increasing focus on Product Engineering.

He is particularly keen to understand more about approaches to ideation, conceptualization and prototyping in the hope of making improvements in the Pet Clinic application development process.

### Brenda (Business) - Pet Clinic Application

**B**renda works in the Pet Clinic Business. One of her goals is to help grow the company, to that end she works with Paulo and the Pet Clinic development team to introduce new features which will leave Pet Clinic's competitors far behind.

A recent foray by the Pet Clinic into Fair Trade pet products was very successful. To leverage that opportunity to its full potential a number of new business applications/modules will be needed in support of the associated product launches.

Brenda is keen to understand how Product Engineering principles can be applied to those developments to help ensure the right product are developed for the intended users in the most efficient manner possible.

### Dan (Developer) - Pet Clinic Application

Dan has been asked to participate in the Product Engineering Chapter to give a developer's perspective and to help tailor the Product Engineering practices for software development.
