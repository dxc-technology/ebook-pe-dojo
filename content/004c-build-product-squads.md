## Build Product Squads

We in the Universal Imports Group want to build the best possible products.

To do that I suggest we should first invest time, energy and budget in to building the best engineering teams that we can. Then we need to make additional investments to support those teams ensuring we foster accountability, creativity and also encourage experimentation.

Simply put stronger engineering teams will build better products.

**M**iyagi any suggestions as to how we might go about doing this?

The structure and culture I recommend for Product Engineering teams is known as the "Product Squad" which was first popularized by Spotify.

Product squads are cross-functional teams comprised of a small number of developers and a product owner. Product squads own a complete product or a specific functional area of a product line, they are also responsible for developing domain expertise in support of an organizations product portfolio.

I am sure you are thinking that sounds remarkably similar to Agile scrum teams.

It is, the key differentiator being in the squad model is that the squad are fully empowered.  They release their work to the business when they deem their work to be ready. More often than not there are no other approvals required.

However with great power comes great responsibility as the squad are on point for

- Writing code.
- Testing the code.
- Testing the functionality.
- Deploying the "live" product.
- Monitoring and supporting the product.
- Managing technical debt.

Makes sense to me. The essence of what you are saying is that we need to empower our teams for success and to trust them to use that power wisely. I think the teams will welcome such an approach.

To do that, we will need to provide our teams some guidance on how to move to a squad model.
